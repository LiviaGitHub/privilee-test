### **Test Scenario: Venue Filter Search Functionality**

- **Feature being tested**:  
  The ability for users to filter venues using the filter modal on the map page.

- **Expected outcome**:  
  - When a user applies specific filters that result in no matching venues, the application should display a friendly message indicating no results were found.
  - Venue items should be hidden, and the system should offer the user an option to reset the filters and start over.
  - When filters are applied with valid results, the system should display the correct number of matching venues, as indicated by a dynamic message in the filter UI.

- **Setup/Teardown procedures**:
  - **Setup**:  
    - Navigate to the Privilee staging map page (`https://staging-website.privilee.ae/map`).
    - Open the filter modal to access the filter options.
    - Ensure that all filter buttons are visible and can be interacted with.
  - **Teardown**:  
    - No specific teardown is needed. Simply end the test after validations.

- **Why this test is important**:  
  This functionality is **essential for a positive user experience** when filtering venues. If no matching venues are found, the system must clearly communicate this to avoid user confusion. Proper handling of empty search results encourages users to adjust filters instead of abandoning the search, thus improving overall engagement and satisfaction.
