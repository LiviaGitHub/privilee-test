### **Test Scenario: Venue Data Accuracy - Location Filter**

- **Feature being tested**:  
  Accuracy of venue location filtering and listing on the map page.

- **Expected outcome**:  
  When a user applies the location filter (e.g., selecting "Dubai"), **only venues from that location** should be displayed.  
  Venues from other locations (e.g., Abu Dhabi, Sharjah) should **not** appear in the results.

- **Setup**:
  - The page must load fresh: `https://staging-website.privilee.ae/map`
  - Open the Filters panel.
  - Apply the **Dubai** location filter and click **Show**.
  - Ensure the environment has venues correctly categorized by location.
- **Teardown**:  
  - No specific teardown is needed.

- **Why it's important**:  
  Correct venue filtering is critical for **data accuracy** and **user trust**.  
  Users rely on filters to find relevant venues quickly.  
  Showing venues from the wrong location can cause confusion, frustration, and **undermine the credibility** of the platform.
