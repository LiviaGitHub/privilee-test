### API Overview

The following overview reflects my understanding of each API endpoint, to support test planning and implementation:

1. **`/public/v2/users`**  
   This endpoint provides access to user-related data. It supports listing existing users via `GET` and allows the creation of new users via `POST`.

2. **`/public/v2/posts`**  
   This endpoint returns a list of all posts available on the platform. It can be used to validate post content, authorship, and structure.

3. **`/public/v2/users/7373665/posts`**  
   This endpoint retrieves all posts associated with the specific user identified by ID `7373665`. It is useful for validating user-specific content and verifying user-post relationships.

4. **`/public/v2/todos`**  
   This endpoint provides access to all tasks (to-dos) available on the platform, including details such as status, title, and due date. It is suitable for verifying task management logic and data integrity.

### Problem

I encountered a token error and had to create a new environment. After exporting the environment, there was an issue with the host configuration.

The problem was that the `host` field in the URL configuration was being passed redundantly, causing the URL to be interpreted incorrectly. For `GET` or `POST` requests, Postman and Newman expect the URL to be configured simply, such as `{{baseURL}}/posts` or `{{baseURL}}/users`, without an extra host field.

For example, this configuration:

```json
"url": {
  "raw": "{{baseURL}}/users",
  "host": [
    "{{baseURL}}"
  ],
  "path": [
    "users"
  ]
}
```

Should be simplified to:

```json
"url": {
  "raw": "{{baseURL}}/users"
}
```
In other words, the complete URL was already being constructed in the `raw` field, so there was no need to pass the host or path separately. Once this was adjusted, Newman was able to correctly identify the target URL.

The failure occurred because the configuration of the host and path was causing the URL to be interpreted incorrectly, resulting in errors like `request URL is empty.` After the correction, the URL became simpler and more direct, resolving the issue.
